      <h1>About Paradise Nursery</h1>
      <p>
        Paradise Nursery began with a simple love for greenery. We curate a
        beautiful collection of houseplants for every home and skill level —
        from easy-care succulents to show-stopping foliage and flowering
        varieties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to help people create calming, healthy, and inspiring
        plant spaces. We provide clear care guidance and hand-select each plant
        for quality. Whether you're a first-time plant parent or a seasoned
        collector, Paradise Nursery has something to brighten your space.
